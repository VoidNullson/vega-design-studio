## Working Guidelines (for agents and contributors)
- Keep server components by default; isolate interactivity in small client components.
- Do not remove files listed in `docs/FEATURE_CONTRACT.md`.
- Use static imports for images and `next/image` (no raw <img>).
- For Los Angeles SEO, keep local copy and LocalBusiness JSON-LD.

## Run
